# DevOps Stage 4 Task 

This implements a mini VPC environment that runs on Linux. It supports subnets, routing, NAT, and isolation just like a Cloud VPC does under the hood. It also allows for deployment of simple web servers in these “subnets” to demonstrate network isolation, routing between subnets, and controlled access across VPCs.

# Installation Requirements
Python 3.12 (or a later release of the Python runtime)
A Linux server or desktop environment

You also need to be logged in as the user to run it.
